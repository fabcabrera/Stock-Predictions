    "The ability to predict the movement of a stock was once far fetched, however, thanks to advancements in machine learning techniques, there is reason to\n",
    "believe short-run predictions are possible, within reason. So what makes stock movement prediction tricky? Well, several factors, but one which is most obscure is market noise. With most persons' having access to the internet, news spreads quickly. This means consumers' sentiments are subject to changing quickly which results in short-run market fluctuations. Exogenous shocks to the market come in many forms and all of which are reported on. With the rise of internet news platforms, these sources server as venues for market particpants to consume stock information which subsequtnely informs short-run behavior. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since we believe that capturing trends in agents news consumption is valuable in explaining short-run movements in stocks, this project will include data from Google Trends and Wikipedia API's to serve as indexes to inform the frequency and popularity of stock news. In addition to data collected from Google Trends and Wikipedia API's we also collect general stock data (open, close, volumem ect.). Through the use of random forrests, artificial neural networks (ANN), and recursive neural networks (RNN) we will contruct a binary-classification task and see how accurately we can model short-run stock movement. While there are an array of targets we could test, the target for the procedding models will be whether the stock closing price will increase tomorrow (1) or whether it will decrease (0). \n",
